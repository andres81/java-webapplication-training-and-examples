Wouldn't it be great to learn new technology or even old technology fast, and hands on? That is the purpose of this project.<br />
Examples showing how technology can be used, and exercises to challenge the reader. 

In addition hoping that starting juniors in the field quickly can get there hands dirty on technology they most probably have<br />
not worked with during there studies in school. Let these ideas evolve, become mature and a vehicle to get the industry to a<br />
higher level, getting to high performance and excellence.
